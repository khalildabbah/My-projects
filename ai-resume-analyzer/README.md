# Resume Analyzer

This is a simple AI-powered app built with Streamlit that analyzes your resume and gives feedback using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 or any LLM model with an API key .

You can upload your resume (PDF or TXT), enter the job title you're applying for, and the app will generate suggestions to improve your content and structure.
